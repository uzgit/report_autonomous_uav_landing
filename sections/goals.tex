In this section we describe the steps in creating a drone platform with the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The drone must be stable in manual flight and capable of autonomous flight.
    \item The drone must be capable of real-time onboard video analysis.
    \item The drone must detect a fiducial marker and track the fiducial marker by aiming a gimbal-mounted camera.
    \item The drone must approach the fiducial marker autonomously and land next to it without human intervention.
\end{itemize}
