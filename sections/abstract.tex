We discuss the design, construction, and operation of two semi-autonomous drones during Summer 2020. The goal of the project is to develop a method for autonomously landing the drones in a target area designated by a fiducial marker and detected by a camera. We have constructed two drone platforms, and have designed and created components to adapt our ideal computational electronics to these platforms. Improvements upon similar projects include mounting the camera on a gimbal to allow a larger detection range, and using a new and computationally efficient fiducial marker system. Design choices, practical challenges, and results are presented. The drones are able to fly reliably and have nearly accomplished the goal of autonomously landing.
